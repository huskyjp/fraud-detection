For each problem that requires a written answer, write (or copy-and-paste)
your answers in this file.  When you are done, you should have replaced all
the ellipses (the three dots) with your answers.

Answer to Problem 7:

Smaller MSE = The more closer from the ideal, so the data is more likely true and not fraudulent
Larger or Equal MSE = The more different from the ideal

We have an output as below: 
    Quantity of MSEs larger than or equal to the 2009 Iranian election MSE: 365
    Quantity of MSEs smaller than the 2009 Iranian election MSE: 9635
    2009 Iranian election null hypothesis rejection level p: 0.0365

And, we set
Null Hypothesis: Iranian election data is showing TRUE
Alternative Hypothesis: Iranian election data is not TRUE


We get 9635 of the random MSEs were smaller than the Iranian election MSE, which means we get 365
of the random MSEs were larger or equal to the Iranian election MSE. 

However, our Null Hypothesis is "Iranian election data is showing true", it is better to look at data from
Iranian side since current output data is from random MSE.

Since we know the quantity of random MSEs smaller than the 2009 Iranian election MSE is 9635, we can say 
only 365 of Iranian election MSE are smaller than random MSE. In other words, the 9992 of Iranian MSEs were 
larger than or equal to the random MSEs. 

Therefore, it is highly unlikely that the Iranian election was genuine, so we say that we are 
96.35% confident that the data are fraudulent. More precisely, we sat that "We reject the Null Hypothesisat 
at the p = 0.0365. (Since our statistical significance is p = 0.05, it satisfies the condition!)

Answer to Problem 8:

We set:
    Null Hypothesis: US election data is showing TRUE
    Alternative Hypothesis: US election data is showing False

We have an ouput as below:
    2008 United States election MSE: 0.0001410025876058068
    Quantity of MSEs larger than or equal to the 2008 United States election MSE:  4753
    Quantity of MSEs smaller than the 2008 United States election MSE:  5247
    2008 United States election null hypothesis rejection level p:  0.4753

We can say that 4753 of 2008 United States election MSEs are smaller than the random MSEs. 
In other words, the 5247 of the United States MSEs were larger than or equal to the random MSEs.

Therefore, only 52.47 of genuine elections were as different from the uniform distribution as
different from the uniform distribution as the US election was. It provides no evidence regarding the
null hypothesis.

Thus, we are failed to reject the null hypothesis and we have p value as 
0.4753 which satisfies the condition, statistical significance = 0.05.)

No one. Thanks for helping me via piazza during such a stressful time^^.
